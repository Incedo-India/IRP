### Applying Migrations on the Project 
Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. They’re designed to be mostly automatic, but you’ll need to know when to make migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.
If you want to change the models you can simply change the code in 'models.py' file in respective app as you require and then run these commands
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate 
python manage.py runserver
```
You can use *showmigration*  to list projects migration.
